TESLA,0.15,">> I THINK IT'S ABOUT AUTONOMOUS. I MEAN, WHEN IT COMES TO PHYSICAL AI, I THINK THERE'S NOTHING BETTER WHEN IT COMES TO PHYSICAL AI THAN NVIDIA AND TESLA. AND I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A GOLDEN CHAPTER FOR TESLA. PHYSICAL AI WHEN IT COMES TO ROBOTAXIS, WHEN IT COMES TO CYBER CABS, VOLUME, PRODUCTION, TRUE AUTONOMOUS. AND OF COURSE, YOU LOOK AT ROBOTICS IN TERMS OF OPTIMISM. I MEAN, KELLY, THAT'S WHY I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT 2 TRILLION ULTIMATELY, PROBABLY A $3 TRILLION MARKET CAP BY LATE 2026, EARLY 2027. THAT'S WHY IT CONTINUES TO BE ONE OF OUR TOP PICKS.",neutral,"COMPANY_SPECIFIC_POSITIVE (Growth, New Product)",0.0
TESLA,0.15,">> I MEAN, WHEN I LOOK OUT NEXT 3 OR 4 YEARS, I THINK EARNINGS POWER IS 4X5X. BUT BECAUSE IT'S MY VIEW THAT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT NOT JUST THE FSD PIECE, BUT IN TERMS OF TRUE AUTONOMOUS, IT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE WHOLE MARGIN PROFILE. IT CHANGES THE WHOLE GROWTH STORY. AND I THINK JUST GOING FORWARD FOR TESLA, THE FOCUS IT'S OKAY. DELIVERIES THEY MATTER. OF COURSE THEY MATTER. BUT IN TERMS OF NEXT FEW YEARS ESPECIALLY MUSK NOW WARTIME CEO IN TERMS OF PAY PACKAGE, YOU KNOW THAT'S ALREADY CEMENTED. THIS IS JUST THE START.

TESLA,0.15,">> WE HAD DAN PRIMACK ON LAST WEEK AND HE SAID, YOU KNOW, I BASICALLY ASKED HIM OR HE SAID THE QUESTION TO ASK IS, WHY IS SPACEX GOING PUBLIC NOW? DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANYTHING RELATED TO FINANCIAL PRESSURE ON TESLA OR MUSK OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT, OR IS IT A POLITICAL WHY WOULD 2026 BE THE YEAR FOR SPACEX?",neutral,"MACRO_RISK (Economy, Inflation, Rates)",0.0
TESLA,0.15,">> WON'T SPACEX BE, IF YOU'LL PARDON THE TERM, SEXIER THAN TESLA? IN OTHER WORDS, RIGHT NOW, IF YOU ARE A BIG FAN OF ELON MUSK AND EVERYTHING HE'S DOING AND THE FUTURE AS DESCRIBED, THIS IS THE ONLY PUBLIC EQUITY YOU CAN OWN FOR THAT STORY. NOW, SPACEX COULD BE THE NEWER, YOUNGER THING ON THE BLOCK. WHAT IF INVESTORS GO WITH THAT AND THUS REMOVE SOME OF THE HALO? RIGHT. THE COMMUNITY EFFECT AROUND THOSE WHO HOLD SHARES OF TESLA IN SUPPORT ITS VALUATION JUST TO HAVE A PIECE OF MUSK.",neutral,"COMPANY_SPECIFIC_POSITIVE (Growth, New Product)",0.0
TESLA,0.15,LOOK I ACTUALLY THINK IT EXPANDS I MEAN TO SOME EXTENT THE ECOSYSTEM FROM SPACE X TO TESLA. AND ULTIMATELY WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE OWNERSHIP XII.,neutral,"COMPANY_SPECIFIC_POSITIVE (Growth, New Product)",0.0
TESLA,0.15,"BECAUSE THE REALITY IS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE, I MEAN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE NEXT FIVE, TEN, 15 YEARS, MUSK AT THE CENTERPIECE OF IT. BUT I THINK IT SPEAKS TO WHEN YOU WHEN IT COMES TO TESLA, THAT CONTINUES TO BE THE BEST PLAY BECAUSE I THINK AUTONOMOUS IS WORTH $1 TRILLION ALONE. YOU THINK ABOUT OPTIMUS IN TERMS OF ROBOTICS. AND AS THIS ALL PLAYS OUT, I THINK GLOBALLY, I MEAN, THEY CAN OWN 70, 80% OF THE AUTONOMOUS MARKET OVER THE GLOBALLY OVER THE COMING YEARS.",neutral,"COMPANY_SPECIFIC_POSITIVE (Growth, New Product)",0.0
TESLA,0.15,">> I KNOW YOU THINK THAT FULL SELF DRIVING PENETRATION COULD BE AS HIGH AS 50%.

TESLA,0.15,"SO THAT'S PART OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS FOR THOSE WHO OWN TESLAS, THEY USE THIS TECHNOLOGY. THE OTHER PART IS THE CYBER CAB. WHAT'S IT CALLED, AND HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE ITS POSITION IN THIS VIS A VIS WAYMO, WHERE WAYMO ALSO DOES QUITE WELL WITH CARS, REALLY EXPENSIVE, REGULATORY AND OTHERWISE? WHAT SHOULD WE EXPECT ON THE LIKE THE CYBER CAB FRONT FROM TESLA?",neutral,"COMPANY_SPECIFIC_POSITIVE (Growth, New Product)",0.0
TESLA,0.15,"SO FROM A MARGIN PERSPECTIVE THAT'S GOING TO BE HUGE. LOOK WAYMO WAYMO IS GOING TO BE A ROUNDING ERROR RELATIVE TO WHAT TESLA'S GOING TO DO I THINK NOT JUST IN THE US BUT I THINK GLOBALLY. LOOK, IT SPEAKS TO JUST HOW EXPENSIVE THOSE CARS ARE, HOW THEY CAN SCALE. AND I THINK WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT AUTONOMOUS AND IN TERMS OF THE ROADMAP, I MEAN, WE WOULD EXPECT PROBABLY SOME SORT OF EXECUTIVE ORDER GOING INTO EARLY NEXT YEAR.
